## Introduction

Model-driven engineering (MDE) represents a paradigm shift in software development, emphasizing the centrality of models in creating robust software applications. This lab is structured around the proficient application of model transformation and code generationâ€”core aspects of MDE. The key objectives involve the use of ATL (Atlas Transformation Language) and QVT (Query/View/Transformation) plugins within the RM2PT tool for model transformation, as well as the application of Acceleo and Xtend plugins for code generation.

## Task 1: Model Transformation (ATL)

### Learning Model Transformation Based on ATL

ATL or Atlas Transformation Language serves as a powerful language within the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) for defining transformations between models. The lab commences with an exploration of ATL through a case study, providing knowledge regarding syntax, semantics, and methodologies for crafting transformation rules.

### Model 1 Transformation in the Chosen Scenario: UniversitiesToPerson

The selected scenario revolves around converting information from a Universities model to a Persons model. This involves using ATL's transformation rules to distinguish academic and non-academic staff from students and mapping them to Employees and Students in the target Persons model.

#### Transformation Strategy

1. **Understanding Source Model (Universities):** Identification of key elements such as University and Community classes representing academic and non-academic staff and students.

3. **Defining Helper Operations:** Introduction of operations like `isEmployee()` for information extraction from the source model.

4. **Handling Relationships:** Utilizing connections established in the source model to maintain associations between elements.

5. **Result Analysis:** Inspection of the resulting output model to ensure successful transformation.

### Model 2 Transformation in the Chosen Scenario: P2P Crypto network 

I started with modelling of P2P Crypto network with one P2P network and 5-10 (variable in number) P2P participating nodes with forward and backward linking in the P2P node-chain. We all know, that this is the model that works for Crypto with Smart Ledger so for this assignment I chose this, still keeping things simple (one P2P network) and 5-10 nodes.

## Task 2: Code Generation (Acceleo)

### Learning Code Generation Based on Acceleo

Acceleo, a model-to-text transformation language, is introduced as a powerful code generator within the Eclipse ecosystem. The lab explores its syntax and capabilities for generating executable code from input models.

### Code Generation in the Chosen Scenario: CatBreedModel

The objective in this scenario is to generate Java code from the CatBreedModel UML diagram using Acceleo templates. This involves defining templates for converting UML elements into executable Java code, ensuring a faithful translation of model elements.

**UML** 

#### Code Generation Strategy

1. **Understanding Input Model:** The input model includes essential elements such as base class Cat and derived breed classes.

2. **Generated Code:** The Java code generated from Acceleo templates reflects the translation of UML model elements into executable code.
